           <h4><b>DISSERTATION</b></h4>
              <h5 id="header-2"><b>Comparative Political Economy of Education and Human Capital</b></h5>
              <p>I have always been drawn to the question of why some politicians but not others have incentives to adopt public policies conducive to economic development. I am particularly interested in the political incentives underlying education policy decisions, given the central importance of education for development. Politicians make decisions that affect the provision of education, with implications for economic development, poverty and inequality.</p>
               <h4 id="research-titles"><b>OTHER WORK IN PROGRESS</b></h4>
              <h5 id="header-2"><b>Endogenous Institutions: Evidence from Public Sector Collective Bargaining Laws in the Unites States</b></h5>
              <p>The widespread belief that public sector collective bargaining increases the costs of government is based on cross-sectional studies that do not consider the possibility that deep-rooted historical factors may explain both the emergence of bargaining institutions and the level of public spending. Using a new longitudinal dataset, I show that those U.S. states that require collective bargaining with local teacher unions tend to employ more teachers, pay higher salaries, and spend more on education, but that they already did so before collective bargaining came into existence. Moreover, in analyses that exploit the staggered introduction of state laws requiring collective bargaining with teachers, I find no support for the claim that these laws increase the costs of government. My results suggest that collective bargaining institutions are less consequential than commonly believed, and that these institutions are a consequence of the same social, political, and economic forces that shape public finance decisions.</p>
              <h5 id="header-2"><b>What Unions Don’t Do: Teacher Unions and Education Reform in Argentina</b></h5>
              <p>A common explanation for the low quality of public education in Argentina and other Latin American countries is that, although politicians want to introduce reforms to improve the quality of education, they are unable to do so because powerful teacher unions block these reforms. I argue that, at least in the case of Argentina, teacher unions have much less influence on education policy than is commonly believed. For multiple reasons that I discuss in detail, the unions are not particularly capable of obtaining what they want, and whenever governments have attempted to introduce large-scale education reform, they have been able to do so despite union opposition. However, politicians have lacked incentives to improve educational quality, and instead have focused their efforts on expanding educational access.</p>
              <h5 id="header-2"><b>Durable Goods for Enduring Voters? Evidence from a School Construction Program in Argentina</b></h5>
              <p>There is ample agreement that politicians often target goods to particular groups of voters, but a heated debate remains on whether they favor core or swing voters. In this paper, I propose a theory of distributive politics that takes into account the nature of the good being distributed, and argue that politicians will use goods that are short-lived or easily taken away to obtain the support of swing voters, but will use durable goods or goods that cannot be easily removed to fuel the loyalty of their core supporters. Within the context of Argentina, previous studies provide support in favor of the first part of this argument. I provide evidence in favor of the second part, showing that the construction of new schools over the period 2003-2012 favored districts that had supported the Kirchner matrimony’s rise to power.</h5>
              <h5 id="header-2"><b>Is Universal Preschool More Resilient to Budget Cuts than Targeted?  Evidence from the Great Recession (with Erica Greenberg)</b></h5>
              <p>Political economy theories of public service provision argue that universal programs, by serving more, and more advantaged, participants, will garner a greater share of public resources and will resist budget cuts more effectively than programs targeted to the poor. We test these claims for the case of public preschool programs, using expenditure data  from all states in the US throughout 2002-2011—and find no support for either claim. In fact, we find that targeted preschool programs spend more per child than universal programs, and that targeted and universal programs were similarly resilient to budget cuts during the Great Recession.</p>
