             <p>Born and raised in Buenos Aires, Argentina, I have always been drawn to the question of why some politicians but not others have incentives to adopt public policies conducive to economic development. I am particularly interested in the political incentives underlying education policy decisions, given the central importance of education for development.</p>
              <p>I approach my work from an interdisciplinary perspective—partly by choice, partly by nature, and mostly because I cannot avoid it. I hold degrees in Economics, Public Policy, and Education, and am currently pursuing doctoral studies in Political Science at Stanford University. </p>
              <p>I have worked on a range of public policy issues, from macroeconomic to labor to education policy; in organizations varying from small think tanks to large international organizations; and in several countries. These experiences have informed the questions I study and how I think about the world. My most recent position prior to moving to Stanford was at the World Bank, where I conducted comparative research on teacher policies, school inspectorates, and the politics of education reform.</p>
              <p>I enjoy teaching as much as research—both are reflections of my enthusiasm for learning!</p>
